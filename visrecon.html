<!-- INSTRUCTIONS -->
<div id="instructions">

Welcome to the demonstration page for the Brownfield Action Simulation. Guided instructions are provided to help familiarize you with the simulation. Alternatively, you may explore the sim on your own.

<b>GUIDED INSTRUCTIONS</b>

Click on the links below to watch the “Phase 1” video and read the related newspaper article. Both introduce a central character, Seymour Buckmeister, as well as the Phase 1 environmental site assessment (ESA). Student environmental consulting companies see the video and read the newspaper article before they sign a contract with Malls-R-Us to perform a Phase 1 ESA and start using the simulation.

                     the frontage of this bar is about 200 feet - just beyond the bar is another open area with more\
                     trees and undergrowth (~100 feet of frontage) - directly across from this open space is a large\
                     asphalt driveway/enternce to the parking lot for the Wedging Nursery (at 10 Loess Lane) - as I\
                     pull into the parking lot I find it to be a bustling place with the small trucks and vans of \
                     local landscapers loading sod, dirt, chips, etc.</p>\

                       10:30 - Ive finally arrived at the front entrance to the abandoned, \
                       Self-Lume factory site Lane(20 Loess Lane) which is about a football field \
                       away from the Wedging driveway and also on the S side of Loess. My key to the \
                       building itself is for the padlocked door in the rear parking lot but I also have\
                       keys for the chainlink gates at both entrances. The property is surrounded by an\
                       eight foot chain link fence. THe 200 ft entrance driveway extends straight to the\
                       S and is surrounded by dense deciduous forest with many large and intermediate trees\
                       and heavy undergrowth especially along the sides of the road. Coming down the road I\
                       can see part of the a water (?) tank on the roof. The foilage is the same around the\
                       parking lot. Both the road and the parking lot are littered with twigs, leaves and the\
                       like. The parking lot is about 150 ft wide and 300 ft long with a rectangular island \
                       (approx 30 x 200 ft) of trees and undergrowth right in the middle of the parking lot. \
                       From the S end of the lot there are two sidewalks about 100 ft apart, the W one leading\
                       to the main entrance (with a slightly rusted Self-Lume, Inc. sign still in place over \
                       the entrance portico) and the E sidewalk leading to a smaller less imposing entrance probably\
                       for workers. Nothing seems unusual - single story, cinder block construction, a flat root\
                       not visible form the ground level, the windows are still intact and closed - the tan paint\
                       is weathered and peeling in places - empty office rooms (no furniture, no debris) are all \
                       one can see through the dirty windows. Large weeds, overgrown shrubs, and several young, \
                       invading trees now surround the building at the front end along the W wall; however at the\
                       SE corner of the parking lot is a sleared area about 40 ft wide running along the E wall\
                       of the factory - all that is growing here are weeds and grasses - the substrate consists\
                       of 3/4 inch diameter gravel with some dirt in the pore spaces - it looks like and old\
                       access road but it is inaccessible to vehicles because seven large glacial erratics have\
                       been moved into place at the edge of the parking lot in front of the cleared area. With\
                       binoculars I can see that this old road extends to the rear parking lot where I will \
                       have a better look.\

                       11:30 AM - About 220 ft. down from Kame Kondos on the \
                       W side of Erratic Avenue is the factory (delivery) entrance to \
                       the Self-Lume site. After unlocking the padlock and opening the \
                       gate and driving down the long (300-400 ft.), wide (50 ft.) road \
                       I enter a large, rectangular paved area (about 200 x 300 ft.). \
                       Both sides of the entrance road are guarded by the same forest \
                       and undergrowth as the other entranceway. As I drive in straight \
                       ahead at the other (W) end of the lot is a concreate pier \
                       (about 10x30 ft.) on which are two gas pumps (old, rusted, no \
                       hoses or nozzels, and no markings, seemingly empty metal shells).\
                        Most of the lot is bordered by the same forest and undergrowth \
                       previously mentioned. There was once a cleared zone (lawn?) about\
                        40 ft. wide along the W side of the building which I can see from \
                       the old pumps but this is now replaced with considerably new growth, \
                       weeds and small, invading trees, etc. Ill walk this area after lunch. \
                       Just to the S of the old fuel pumps at the edge of the parking \
                       lot is a wide area (about 100 x 100 ft., but irregularly shaped), \
                       once cleared (there is no old growth), with similar vegetation to \
                       that along the W wall of the factory - this disturbed area extends \
                       out into the older forest. Upon closer inspection the substrate of \
                       this area is dirt and gravel mixed with chunks of concrete, pieces \
                       of cinder block, asphalt, and other debris (a piece of 2 by 4, metal \
                       flashing, and old pail, and a half-buried bucket of tar) - this is a \
                       fairly recent landfill of some sort. Returning to the car by the pumps \
                       I now drive to two old trailers (rusting, rodent infested with flat, \
                       rotting tires) in the far SE corner of the lot - they are empty except \
                       for piles of flattened, bundled, and now rotted cardboard boxes that \
                       the animals seem to love. I return to the car and drive to the back \
                       entrance after passing the two loading docks in the right rear(facing N) \
                       of the building. The large metal back door is in the center of the \
                       building close to weternmost loading dock. Rather than begin an interior \
                       inspection I decide to have lunch.\
